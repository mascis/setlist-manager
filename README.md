# setlist-manager

Android app for musicians who play live shows. A musician can save songs on a device as individual files (images, txt, pdf) and create setlists for different events. Songs of a setlist can be swiped through in a full-screen viewer.

# Implementation

App is being developed using Android Studio. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) using [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is used as an architectural pattern. SQLite database is implemented using [Room Database Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html). For viewing PDF files the app utilizes [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer).
